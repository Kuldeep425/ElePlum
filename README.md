# ElePlum

ElePlum is a Java-based Android application that addresses the real-world challenge of connecting electricians and customers on a unified platform. This project aims to streamline the process of finding reliable electricians and requesting their services, enhancing convenience and efficiency for both parties.

The application aims to provide a seamless experience for customers in locating electricians, submitting service requests, and receiving timely responses. Electricians, on the other hand, will benefit from increased visibility, the ability to manage their schedules, and access to potential work opportunities. Our goal is to bridge the gap between electricians and customers, creating a reliable and convenient solution for all electrical service needs.




## Features:

- Customers can easily locate electricians in their vicinity, view profiles,experience, and ratings.
- Customers can submit service requests, specifying their electrical needs and preferred appointment times.
- Seamless communication between customers and electricians through call and chat functionalities.
- Electricians receive notifications for service requests matching their availability.
- Electricians can create bills for their services and express interest in tasks created by users. 
- Customers can provide feedback on electricians' services to help others make informed decisions.
- Users can immediately connect to random electrician via call for immediate task.
